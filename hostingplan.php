															<h3>Premium DNS</h3>
														</header>
														<p>Every domain name is given a series of numbers known as an IP address â€” for example, the IP address for www.recreationcloud.com is 192.186.225.99. It's this number that your browser uses to locate a particular website.When you type a domain name into your browser, the DNS (Domain Name Server) looks through a huge database to find the IP address you requested and then directs your browser to the correct website content.</p>

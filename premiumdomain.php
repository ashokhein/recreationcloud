															<h3>Premium DNS</h3>
														</header>
														<p>Every domain name is given a series of numbers known as an IP address â€” for example, the IP address for www.recreationcloud.com is 192.186.225.99. It's this number that your browser uses to locate a particular website.When you type a domain name into your browser, the DNS (Domain Name Server) looks through a huge database to find the IP address you requested and then directs your browser to the correct website content.</p>

															<h3>Free Domain Privacy</h3>
														</header>
														<p>Purchase any 24-month hosting plan and your Domain is free for the first year. Choose from any available .com, .net, .org, .in, .co.in or .edu domain name.Domain privacy is a service offered by a number of domain name registrars. A user buys privacy from the company, who in turn replaces the user's info in the WHOIS with the info of a forwarding service (for email and sometimes postal mail, done by a proxy server), such as "Domains by Proxy, Inc." or eNom's "ID Protect".<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_privacy" target="_new">(wiki)</a> </p>

															<h3>Certified Domain</h3>
														</header>
														<p>A Certified Domain lets people know that GoDaddy has formally certified the domain's registration. Read on for answers to your questions about getting started with domain certification.A Certified Domain provides visible evidence (in the form of the Domain Origination Certified seal) that a domain has been validated and its registrant's credentials have been verified. For this reason a Certified Domain is useful to owners of business websites and other sites that offer transactions and other activities of a sensitive nature. All site owners, however, can improve their site's legitimacy and trustworthiness by displaying the Domain Origination Certified seal.<a href="http://tracedseals.starfieldtech.com/siteseal/verify?ci=80777&sealId=cb55dcfeb7e9372266d4979a298dc088fc092c034e6a8ca8ccce8457af486453" target="_new">(Sample)</a></p>

											<h2>Premium DNS</h2>
										</header>
										<p>Proper DNS management and security is critical in keeping your website, email and online applications up and running. Premium DNS makes it easy to manage and secure your DNS so your website is always available, performing reliably and safe from hackers who try to reroute your site and steal sensitive customer information. What is DNS and why do I need to manage it?</p>

										<p><strong>Solve top DNS issues to improve security, reliability and performance.</strong></p>

										<p><strong>Problem: Hackers attempt to hijack your site and steal customer data.</strong></p>
										<p>Hijacking is a risk with all DNS systems around the world. It's a common way for hackers to steal private information. When a customer types in your Web address, the hacker interrupts the DNS lookup process and sends the user to a fake and malicious site that may look like your website.</p>
										<p>Domain locking prevents accidental or intentional transfers of domain ownership and stops anyone from redirecting your nameservers.</p>
										<p><strong>Solution: </strong>Premium DNS (enabled with DNSSEC) creates an unbreakable "chain of trust" between the visitor's browser and your server, verifying that the visitor is actually arriving at your website.</p>
										<p><strong>Problem: Keep all Web exchanges private.</strong></p>
										<p>Another way hackers steal credit card numbers and other sensitive information is through "eavesdropping." Hackers sit on the DNS server and "listen in" on messages, logins and passwords as customers access your site.</p>
										<p><strong>Solution:</strong> By verifying the visitor is at the intended website, Premium DNS shuts eavesdropping down.</p>
										<br />

										</span>                                        
										<p><strong>Problem: "Website not found" errors cause you to lose visitors and sales.</strong></p>
										<p>It's never good when users get a "website not found" error. At best, they think you're unprofessional; at worst, they think you don't exist.</p>
										<p>Domain locking prevents accidental or intentional transfers of domain ownership and stops anyone from redirecting your nameservers.</p>
										<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Premium DNS makes sure your site is always available by using the Anycast global network, which provides multiple layers of redundancy. Your DNS records are distributed on servers throughout the U.S., Europe and Asia, so if one server should go down, your website will still be online. With unlimited secondary DNS, you always have a failsafe in case of a major outage.</p>

										</span>                                        
										<p><strong>Problem: Visitors experience delays or "time outs" trying to reach your site.</strong></p>
										<p>There's a lot riding on the physical distance between your visitors and your server. Customers who live far away may experience a delay in reaching your site or even get a "website not found" error message. The more cable between your server and your customer's computer, the longer it takes for them to reach your site.</p>
										<p>Domain locking prevents accidental or intentional transfers of domain ownership and stops anyone from redirecting your nameservers.</p>
										<p><strong>Solution:</strong> The Premium DNS infrastructure offers improved security and faster resolution than the standard infrastructure. And since your information is distributed across DNS servers around the world, customers connect to the closest server location for a quicker response.</p>
